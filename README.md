# Advent-of-Code

## [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual Advent calendar of programming puzzles put together by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz). 

**This is my Advent of Code repo. There are many others like it, but this one is mine.**

I learned about Advent of Code mid December, 2022 from a Yammer post at my work. 

I'd been looking for a way to gain familiarity with C# and generally modernize my skills and this seemed a great way to start. 

The first few puzzles went by easily enough with the knowledge I had. Since then, I have learned a lot about graphs, algorithms, trees, bit shifting, and all manner of math and programming tricks and techniques.
