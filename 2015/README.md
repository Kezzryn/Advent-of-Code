2015 Puzzle Summary 

Day 1 - Not Quite Lisp
- Track location based on inputs. 
- Loop through the string incrementing and decremeting a counter

Day 2 - I Was Told There Would Be No Math
- Find volume, area, perimeter and smallest side calulations on a rectangle.
- Abuse of anonymous arrays and LINQ syntax to calulate the smallest sides of things.
- Honestly, I was surprised I was allowed to define an anonymous array like that. Learning is fun. :) 

Day 3 - Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum
- Trace all visited locations.
- Iterate over the moves and add to a hashset. 

Day 4 - The Ideal Stocking Stuffer
- MD5 hashing. 
- Pulled code from documentation examples for MD5 hash creation. Not sure if there's a faster way to find the answer to part2, then to simply brute force it. 

Day 5 - Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?
- Substring parsing. 
- This solution could probably be improved with liberal applcation of Regex.

Day 6 - Probably a Fire Hazard
